# Improving Computer Vision Accuracy using Convolutions: An R Version
 
Hello! Welcome to the fourth (includes the 3rd) R code walkthrough of the series [Machine Learning Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9TRANg4c0&list=PLOU2XLYxmsII9mzQ-Xxug4l2o04JBrkLV) where Laurence Moroney,a Developer Advocate at Google working on Artificial Intelligence, takes us through the fundamentals of building machine learning models using TensorFlow.

In this episode, Laurence Moroney takes us through yet another exciting application of Machine Learning. Here, we put convolutions and pooling to use and create our own convolutional neural networks! This makes the Fashion MNIST neural network more efficient â€“ because it will classify based on features, and not on raw pixels. Convolutional layers learn the features and pass these to the dense layers which map the learned features to the given labels.

Like the previous R Notebooks, this Notebook tries to replicate the Python Notebook used for this episode.
